SSH login through SSH-key

need to generate ssh-key


Step 1
-->ssh-keygen 

output:
[root@star .ssh]# ssh-keygen
Generating public/private rsa key pair.
Enter file in which to save the key (/root/.ssh/id_rsa):  ----> key generation path press enter
/root/.ssh/id_rsa already exists.
Overwrite (y/n)? y
Enter passphrase (empty for no passphrase):   ----->ssh-key password
Enter same passphrase again:
Your identification has been saved in /root/.ssh/id_rsa.
Your public key has been saved in /root/.ssh/id_rsa.pub.
The key fingerprint is:
SHA256:k+4LLzVtikbhWEDwboYAu7lcxQWQHTHW0qlh6KSB7VU root@star.sixthstar.in
The key's randomart image is:
+---[RSA 2048]----+
|o..+*BE..        |
|oo.===o+         |
|o.=.o++          |
| =.+..o  .       |
|o ..++ .S.       |
|...o. o.o.o      |
|..   ..o.+       |
|      ++.        |
|     . .+.       |
+----[SHA256]-----+

step 2
-->cd /root/.ssh/

-->ssh-copy-id -i ~/.ssh/id_rsa root@103.173.112.16

then it ask 103.173.112.16 server root password
enter root password
 
output:
[root@star .ssh]# ssh-copy-id -i ~/.ssh/id_rsa root@103.173.112.16
/usr/bin/ssh-copy-id: INFO: Source of key(s) to be installed: "/root/.ssh/id_rsa.pub"
/usr/bin/ssh-copy-id: INFO: attempting to log in with the new key(s), to filter out any that are already installed
/usr/bin/ssh-copy-id: INFO: 1 key(s) remain to be installed -- if you are prompted now it is to install the new keys
root@103.173.112.16's password:

Number of key(s) added: 1

Now try logging into the machine, with:   "ssh 'root@103.173.112.16'"
and check to make sure that only the key(s) you wanted were added.


step 3:

then after this next time we want to get ssh for that server means it ask only ssh-key password if you want to take ssh without asking password means while creatine ssh-keygen create as empty password.

--> ssh root@103.173.112.16

output:

[root@star .ssh]# ssh root@103.173.112.16
Enter passphrase for key '/root/.ssh/id_rsa':
